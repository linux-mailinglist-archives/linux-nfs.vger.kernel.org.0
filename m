Well, SQLite does locking but no queuing.
So, as soon somebody is writing the data base it is locked and all other
read/writes will fail either with SQLITE_BUSY or SQLITE_LOCKED.
It is up to the user how to react on that.
 
That's why I chose to use a shared rwlock where a task can *wait* upon
conflicting access.

Maybe there is a better way do it, dunno.

In the current design generated fsidnums will stay forever while the paths
in subvolumes can get cleaned.

I think we talked about that already and agreed that it should work without
touching. So far I didn't had a chance to investigate into this.

The CHECK is just a paranoid check. My SQL INSERT generates ids starting with 1.
Sure, if you run it 2^32 times, it will fail due to the CHECK.
