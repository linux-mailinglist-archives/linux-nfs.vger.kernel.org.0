Chuck,

I think we can both agree there is no real benefit to us trading
punches and looking like fools more than we already have.

I say that not to impugn you or your position, but we look foolish.

I will pull my punches entirely (I really am, I could blow up
everything and that'll really be career limiting, heh).  My aim is to
say my peace in this reply and hopefully we can set this unfortunate
exchange to one side. 

I'll learn what I can from it, maybe you will, maybe others will...

Perception is reality, so your reality is different than mine.

Neil, Christoph and yourself all took my last "Who has taken to feign"
sentence above as some ad-hominem attack.  It wasn't, Christoph was
acting like the localio code incomprehensible for effect.

I am _not_ questioning (and _never_ have questioned) Christoph's
extensive contributions, experience or intelligence.

I am calling out that Christoph didn't actually review the localio
code but proceeded to make extreme baseless negative judgments of it.

And you've glossed over that entirely and made it about "Christoph is
Christoph, who are you again?". Well aware who he is but I'm saying
baseless negative judgments are also a very regular occurrence from
him when he decides he just wants to blow up what I am doing (could be
he has done this to others, I have no idea).  It isn't about the
technical details in the moment he does this, if he says it it must be
true, the aim is taint my work.  Sad because I thought that dynamic
died when I finally relented in our feud over NVMe vs DM multipath
that spanned 2018 to 2021)

But damnit, it is happening all over again, now in the context of
localio. And you're buying it because he is parroting your concerns
about "why can't pNFS be used instead!?"

Neil won't get an answer after having called Christoph out on this
(unless Christoph now wants to try to make a liar out of me by
fabricating something well after his moment to do so has passed):
https://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=172021727813076&w=2

If Christoph could arrest his propensity to do harm where it not
warranted I'd take every single technical critical feedback very
seriously and adjust the code as needed.  When it is about the code,
_actually_ about the code.. Christoph rules.

He knows this, happy to say it (again): I respect his technical
ability, etc.  I do _not_ respect him making blanket statements about 
code without saying _why_ he arrived at his judgment.

See a non-sequitur that takes shots at Hammerspace isn't professional.

Over the numerous iterations of localio there have been a handful of
times you have taken to name drop "Hammerspace" with a negative
connotation, simmering with contempt.  Like I and others should feel
shame by association.

They haven't done anything wrong here.  Trond hasn't done anything
wrong here.  Whatever you grievance with Hammerspace, when interacting
with me please know I don't have any context for it.  It is immaterial
to me and I don't need to know.  If/when you have individual technical
problems with something Hammerspace is doing let's just work it
through without it needing to be this awkward elephant.

> > Guess the messenger gets shot sometimes.

Statements like that show you're going out of your way to make an
enemy of me with no _real_ basis.  But let me be clear: I have
absolutely been a victim of bullying and serious psychological attacks
over this past week, particularly repeat gaslighting by both you and
Christoph.  That you're so unaware of how you have spun a false
narrative and are now tag-teaming with Christoph to attack me further
has been apparent for all to see. Hopefully linux-nfs is low traffic ;)

You have obviously formed an unfavorable opinion of me, apparent
turning point was my v11 patch header and ensuing negative exchange. I
own being too pushy when seeking progress on localio v11's inclusion
for 6.11; I apologized for that.

Hopefully we can actually get past all of this.

> You act like our questions are personal attacks on you.

No, I act like your personal attacks are personal attacks.  Questions
and technical issues are always fair game.  I pushed back on _one_
of your NFSD requirements (tracepoints), sorry if that was some
indication that I'm a malcontent.. but I'm not.  I can have a
technical opinion though.  SO I may make them known at times.

I'm not afraid to admit when I don't know something (I've said it to
you when we met at LSF).  I'm in no way an expert in NFS, you are.  I
respect your command of NFS and welcome learning from you (like I have
to this point and hope to in the future).

I haven't ever heard from anyone at Hammerspace about you.  And I
haven't sought insight about you either.  AFAIK you aren't on anyone's
mind within Hammerspace (other than me given I'm actively dealing with
this unfortunate situation).

Well I in no way intended it to be petulant.  I was trying to reduce
the attack surface.  And if you'd trust me at my word that'd go a long
way.

Try to take a step back and trust me when I tell you something.
You're welcome to unfulfilled by an answer and seek clarity, but I
promise you I'm not evasive or leaving information on the floor when
I answer questions.  If I don't know something I seek the details out.

But you and Christoph are making a simple line of development
(localio) into some referendum on design choices in layers you have no
charter to concern yourself with (Hammerspace's data movers). You
still cannot accept that localio is devoid of pNFS use case
requirements (as required by Hammerspace) but still see fit to
reengineer the feature in terms of pNFS.

Hammerspace simply wants to optimize an NFS client on a host
connecting to an NFSD running in a container on the same host.  It is
doing that in service to its distributed namespace that it is hosting
in disparate NFSD instances.  But the "data movers" are a sideband
remapping/reshaping/rebalancing service.  Completely disjoint from the
distribute pNFS namespace that the primary (flexfiles) clients are
accessing.

I'll consult with Trond to try to see how he suggests appeasing your
request more than I already have.  But you really are departing
heavily from the narrow scope that localio covers.

Projecting attributes and actions onto me doesn't make them true. I
haven't done or said most of the things you just asserted there.

I pushed back on tracepoints, but in the end I removed all the
dprintk()s from the NFSD code.

Your words say otherwise, they have become quite negatively charged to
harm in the last week, but please let's just move on.  I'm serious, no
lasting harm done from my vantage point, I can move on if you can.

Thanks,
Mike
