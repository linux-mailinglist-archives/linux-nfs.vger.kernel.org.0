Ok, fair.

I have never seen a case with a malicious NFS client, and I'm also sure if I
were to run a malicious client I couldn't think of a better way of raising
my hand to say so.

I've seen a lot of misbehaving middle-boxes, or incorrectly setup split
routing, or migrated-across-the-network clients..

I don't immediately have more details at hand beyond what I've already said
- when a customer says they're seeing this message and NFS is slow or
failing in some way, its a big short cut to finding the problem.

Of course, but that tracepoint would have to be enabled in order to see that
a significant disruption in the client-server conversation was occuring.

That's all I have for this patch -- just giving some feedback.
