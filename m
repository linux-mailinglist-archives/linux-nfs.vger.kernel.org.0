Well, like I say, we could have a fallback.  Or even provide alternative
scripts in nfs-utils and let the distro decide which to install
depending on whether they use systemd.

But, whatever, those two alternatives (machine-id or vs. nfs generating
its own uuid) are basically the same on some level.

I agree with the basic idea that this should be automated rather than
living in a configuration file that humans might have to deal with.
