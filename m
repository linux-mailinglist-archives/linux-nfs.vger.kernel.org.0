We already have the lock over all those operations.

I was worried that wouldn't prevent a getattr in another thread from
updating the change attribute.  Is that not possible?

My only idea for returning extra information was a hack using
kthread_data() as we're doing in nfsd_breaker_owns_lease(); nfs would
call something like:

	void nfsd_set_cinfo(struct nfs4_change_info *cinfo)
	{
		struct svc_rqst *rqst;

		if (!i_am_nfsd())
			return;
		rqst = kthread_data(current);
		rqst->cinfo = cinfo;
	}

Then nfsd fetches it afterwards.  Maybe there's a better way.
