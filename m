We agree there are inefficiencies with the proposed scheme. The
Merkle tree would be rehydrated at measurement time, and used at
read time to verify the results of each subsequent NFS READ.

We assume that parts of the tree and parts of the file content
can be evicted from the client's memory at any time. So verifying
READ results may require rehydration of some or all of the Merkle
tree. If we're careful, eviction might avoid the higher levels of
the tree to prevent the need to read the whole file again.

So, maybe we want to store the first level or two of the tree as
well? Obviously there is a limit to how much can be stored in an
extended attribute.

I am very interested in using EVM_IMA_DIGSIG. However, there appears
to be a consensus that for cases like NFS, every readpage result needs
to be verified, just as fs-verity does it.

I suppose measurement for an NFS file could involve verifying a
saved linear hash while at the same time constructing a Merkle tree
on the client?

My interest is content provenance (authenticity), where both a
digest and its signature are required. I can't speak for how
others want to use this metadata.
