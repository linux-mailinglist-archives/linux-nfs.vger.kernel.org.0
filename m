At least in XFS terms, that metadata uuid is the persistent, never
changing uuid in the metadata headrs.

Which is really dangerous and should not be used in normal operation.
For XFS with support it with a nouuid option, mostly for historic
reasons and to be able to change the uuid transactional using an
ioctl.

dev_t is not related to the uuid in any way for XFS, and while I'm not
an expert there I'm pretty sure ext4 uses the same not dev related uuid
generation.

I still wonder what the use case is here.  Looking at André's original
mail it states:

"However, btrfs mounts may have volatiles UUIDs. When mounting the exact same
disk image with btrfs, a random UUID is assigned for the following disks each
time they are mounted, stored at temp_fsid and used across the kernel as the
disk UUID. `btrfs filesystem show` presents that. Calling statfs() however
shows the original (and duplicated) UUID for all disks."

and this doesn't even talk about multiple mounts, but looking at
device_list_add it seems to only set the temp_fsid flag when set
same_fsid_diff_dev is set by find_fsid_by_device, which isn't documented
well, but does indeed seem to be done transparently when two file systems
with the same fsid are mounted.

So André, can you confirm this what you're worried about?  And btrfs
developers, I think the main problem is indeed that btrfs simply allows
mounting the same fsid twice.  Which is really fatal for anything using
the fsid/uuid, such NFS exports, mount by fs uuid or any sb->s_uuid user.

What's an A/B partition?  And how are these safely used at the same time?
