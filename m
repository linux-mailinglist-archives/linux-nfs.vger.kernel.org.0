The request was to set that parameter...

You probably can say that for every /etc/*.conf file...  
not being namespace aware... how can they be...

In the kernel document you say "Specifying a uniquifier string is 
not support for NFS clients running in containers."

Why isn't that enough?

Point.

How does this break? If all the clients have unique ids
what breaks?

Or are you saying setting the unique id like this:

options nfs nfs4_unique_id="64fd26280451566d648ab0e0b7384421"

in modprobe.d/nfs.conf is not namespace safe?

If we shouldn't expose it... Lets get rid of it... 
You added the param in the fall 2012... If it hasn't
been used correctly or can't be used correctly for
all theses years... why does it exist?

I'll address this in Trond's reply... 

thanks!
