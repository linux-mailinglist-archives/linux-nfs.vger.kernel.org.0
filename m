I can't see how this would work, but maybe I don't have a good enough
imagination.

The high-level view of the proposed protocol is:
  - client asks remote server to identify itself.
  - server returns an identity
  - client uses local-sideband to ask each local server if it has the
    given identity.

I don't see where an O_TMPFILE could fit into this, or how a different
high-level approach would be any better.

For NFSv3 the client could ask with a new Program or Version or
Procedure, or all three.  Or it could ask with a new file-handle or path
name.  I imagine using a webnfs (rfc2054) multi-component lookup on the
public filehandle for "/linux/config/server-id" and getting back a
filehandle which encodes the server ID somehow.  All these seem credible
options and it is not clear than any one is better than any other.

For NFSv4.1 I think that LOCALIO looks a lot like trunking and so using
exactly the same mechanism to determine if two servers are the same is a
good idea.
But then LOCALIO also looks a lot like a new pNFS/DS protocol so maybe
we should specify that protocol and use GETDEVICELIST or GETDEVICEINFO
to find the identity of the server.

I think that if we use anything other than the server-id in the
EXCHANGE_ID response, then we are defining a new protocol as it is a new
request which we expect existing servers to ignore or fail, even though
they have never been tested to ignore/fail that particular request.

Of all the options I would guess that a new version for an existing
protocol would be safest as that is the most likely to have been tested.
A new RPC program is probably conceptually simplest.  A little hack in
LOOKUPv3 to detect the public filehandle etc is probably the easiest to
code, and a new pnfs/ds protocol is probably the cleanest overall
except that it doesn't support NFSv3.

My purpose in all this is not to replace Mike's LOCALIO protocol, but to
explore the solution space to ensure there is nothing that is obviously
better.  As yet, I don't think there is.
