I think I understand you idea of look at thing as "service parameters"
instead of "kernel parameters", but looking at the actual parameters
that might be a bit difficult. 

Some do map to a service like nfs4_disable_idmapping could be set 
from /etc/idmapd.conf, but things like send_implementation_id or 
delegation_watermark do not really map to a particular service
or am I missing something?

Interesting idea...I would think nfsmount.conf would be the
right place.

I think supporting configs per namespaces is a good idea. I don't
think it would be too difficult to do since we already support
the nfs.d directory.

I'm a bit namespace challenged... but as I see it using 
"ip netns identify" (w/out the [PID]) would return all of
the current network network namespaces. Then we would run through 
the /etc/nfs.conf.d/ directory looking for a matching directory
for any of the returned namespaces. If found that config
would be used. Something along those lines? 

With multiple namespaces, how would we know which one to use?

I think I would like to continue exploring the namespace patch verse 
adding another mount option.
