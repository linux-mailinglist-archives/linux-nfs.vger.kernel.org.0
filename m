Thanks for continuing to look into this, it's interesting work.

Sorry, I haven't checked--what is that number, really?  It's probably
not the fsid returned from the server, as that wouldn't be guaranteed
unique across multiple servers.  But that means it's probably generated
in a way that doesn't guarantee it's stable across reboots.  And we need
filehandles to work across reboots.

I think we've got to generate fsid's ourself and keep an on-disk
database.

We might be able to do better, but I think a v4-only solution to start
would be OK.

I think something like that's more like what we need.

We can provide options if we need to, but the costs of options can be
underestimated.  Ideally we'd at least have a default that's safe and
works for most cases.
