I just tested it. It does help (qemu doesn't crash anymore) but it doesn't eliminate the issue (VM still doesn't boot)

The VM now starts but it drops into the UEFI shell.

Once again, disabling O_DIRECT helps (that is -aio=threads,cache=writeback)

For the reference, few kernels ago, I had an unrelated bug (not even NFS related, it was happening locally as well),
which caused the exact same drop to the UEFI shell when using O_DIRECT:

https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg912549.html

It was decided that this issue is a qemu issue because it relied on undefined kernel behavior which has changed,
so the qemu got patched to fix the issue on its side.

Since sometimes I use an older qemu version, I had this kernel commit reverted for now, but to be sure I now had built a kernel
without the revert on both server and the client, and tested with the latest qemu which has the fix for the bug.

I don't remember details of this unrelated bug, but if I remember correctly, qemu had trouble reading first 512 bytes of the virtual disk, when
the VM tried to do so to read the boot sector.
