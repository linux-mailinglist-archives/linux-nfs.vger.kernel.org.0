So we are re-hashing a discussion we had a few months ago (Amir was
involved at least).

I don't think we want to expose cgroupfs via NFS that's super weird.
It's like remote partial resource management and it would be very
strange if a remote process suddenly would be able to move things around
in the cgroup tree. So I would prefer to not do this.

So my preference would be to really sever file handles from the export
mechanism so that we can allow stuff like pidfs and nsfs and cgroupfs to
use file handles via name_to_handle_at() and open_by_handle_at() without
making them exportable.

Somehow I thought that Amir had already done that work a while ago but
maybe it was really just about name_to_handle_at() and not also
open_by_handle_at()...
