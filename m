No need to worry, take your time.

The reason why setting the timeout to 0 is still needed is because
when mountd uncovers a subvolume but no client uses it a filehandle,
it is not locked and can be unmounted later.
Only when nfsd sees a matching filehandle the reference counter will
be increased and umounting is no longer possible.
