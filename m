The toughest problem to deal with is reboot of the re-export server.  If
you want this to work across reboots, then you need to pick an fsid that
will be the same across reboots.

Also, you need to deal with getting an fsid for a filesystem that isn't
mounted yet.  That's because, if you reboot while a client is using
/srv/nfs/vol0, when you come back up, the client *isn't* going to look
up the path /srv/nfs/vol0 again--it's just going to give you a
filehandle for some object under there, and you're going to have to
figure out what to do with that.

Simplest might be recording the fsid's you use in an on-disk database.
knfsd makes an upcall to rpc.mountd each time it encounters a new fsid,
so maybe that'd mean you could do all the management of that database in
rpc.mountd and minimize required kernel patches.

Maybe a last-resort option would be just to not support reboot of the
re-export server.  That's already what we do for locking.  I'm not happy
about that, and have some vague ideas how it might be fixed, but not
anything that's likely to be done soon.

Then I think a random fsid might be OK.  I believe fsids can be up to 32
bits so there's effectively no chance of collisions.

But, I can't remember, can those nfs automounts expire?  An export that
looks idle from the server's point of view might still be in use by a
client, so we can't drop that mount and then get stuck returning ESTALE
when the client does eventually try to use it.
