What is the final resolution regarding this option?
I can think of embedded/memory constraint systems where the dependency on SQLite
is not wanted.

On the other hand, with my latest patch, the plugin interface, the could be solved
too.

*kind ping* :-)

Please also don't forget the kernel side of this work. It is small but still needed.
See: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20220110184419.27665-1-richard@nod.at/
or
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rw/misc.git/log/?h=nfs_reexport_clean

Since the kernel changes don't change the ABI, it should not really matter which part
is merged first. Kernel or userspace. The only important part is stating the right
kernel version in the nfs-utils manpages.

Thanks,
//richard
