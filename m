The compelling reason is that it's generally faster (or less work for
the NFS server and its storage) to sync the metadata after the client
has sent all of the data it wants to write. This amortizes the cost of
the metadata operations, and allows the server to get the written data
persisted (if it makes sense to do that) while waiting for the COMMIT.

Since your patch asserts IOCB_DSYNC for all direct write segments,
NFSD_IO_DIRECT (as it is implemented in your patch) does not need a
subsequent COMMIT operation. Forcing the client to COMMIT is totally
unnecessary. That's why I suggested promoting all NFSD_IO_DIRECT WRITEs
to FILE_SYNC.

So perhaps the issue here is that the rationale for using IOCB_DSYNC
for all NFSD_IO_DIRECT writes is hazy and needs to be clarified.

The client ensures that UNSTABLE + COMMIT is just as "safe" as
FILE_SYNC, generally, by preserving the dirty data in its own page cache
until the server indicates the written data is durable and is safe to
evict if needed.

If you want to make an argument about data integrity, let's
be as precise as we can about what we believe might be unsafe. The
data integrity doubt was with the unaligned ends, IIRC? If we need
that extra bit of integrity, then WRITEs with an unaligned portion
will need to be IOCB_DSYNC, and then promoted.

An NFS WRITE, even an UNSTABLE one, I believe makes the written data
visible to other readers. That might be an argument for using IOCB_DSYNC
with IOCB_DIRECT, so that subsequent NFS READs (and local applications)
see the written data as soon as NFSD generates a response to an NFS
WRITE backed by IOCB_DIRECT.

I think we also discussed that an NFS WRITE should make updates visible
in byte order, which is why the segments are handled low offset to high
offset.

Or, we might decide that, no, NFS WRITE has no data visibility mandate;
applications achieve data visibility explicitly using COMMIT and file
locking, so none of this matters.


> And we already showed that doing so really isn't slow.

Well we don't have a comparison with "IOCB_DIRECT without IOCB_DSYNC".
That might be faster than what you tested? Plus I think your test was
on esoteric enterprise NVMe devices, not on the significantly more
commonly deployed SSD devices.
