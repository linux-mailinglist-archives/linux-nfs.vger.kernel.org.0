Btw, "allow ... clients to open by filehandle" is another confusion.

NFSv4 OPEN does do access checking and authorization.

Again, it's NFS READ and WRITE that are not blocked.

NFSv3 READ and WRITE do an intrinsic open.

NFSv4 READ and WRITE permit the use of a special stateid so that an OPEN
isn't necessary to do the I/O (IIRC).

The rationale provided here doesn't convince me that fabrication is the
biggest threat and will give us the biggest bang for our buck if it is
mitigated.

In order to carry out this attack, the attacker has to have access to
the filehandles on an NFS client to examine them. She has to have
access to a valid client IP address to send NFS requests from. Maybe
you can bridge the gap by explaining how a /non-root/ user on an NFS
client might leverage FH fabrication to gain access to another user's
files. I think only the root user has this ability.

I've also tried to convince myself that cryptographic FH validation
could mitigate misdirected WRITEs or READs. An attacker could replace
the FH in a valid NFS request, for example, or a client might send
garbage in an FH. I'm not sure those are real problems, though.

I am keeping in mind that everything here is using AUTH_SYS anyway, so
maybe I'm just an old man yelling at a cloud. Nothing here is blocking
yet, but I want the feature to provide meaningful value (as I think you
do).

Thank you for bearing with me.
