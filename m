Yep, up to 15seconds.

Should be available for "work" yes, but why "other work"?  Is COPY work
not as important as READ or WRITE or GETATTR work?
READ/WRITE are limited to 1MB, sync-COPY to 4MB so a small difference
that, but it doesn't seem substantial.

I agree with not increasing it.  I don't see the rational for reducing
workload, only for limiting it.

Any more so that having nfsd thread handling a WRITE workload?

That sounds like a good goal.  Ideally we would need a way to negotiate
a window with write-back throttling so that we don't bother reading
until we know that writing to the page-cache won't block.  Certainly
worth exploring.

This isn't obvious to me.  The server makes no promise concerning the
throughput it will provide.  Having a list of COPY requests that add up
to many terabytes isn't intrinsically a problem.  Having millions of
COPY requests in the list *might* be a little bit of a burden.  Using
__GFP_NORETRY might help put a natural limit on that.

Yes, it needs to be handled.  Declaring it invalid is certainly an
option for handling it.  I didn't quite feel I could justify that in
this case.

Why does server-to-server require async COPY?
RFC 7862 section 4.5.  Inter-Server Copy says
  The destination server may perform the copy synchronously or
  asynchronously.
but I see that nfsd4_copy() returns nfs4err_notsupp if the inter-server
copy_is_sync(), but it isn't immediately obvious to me why.  The patch
which landed this functionality doesn't explain the restriction.

I guess that with multiple 4MB sync COPY requests the server would need
to repeatedly mount and unmount the source server which could be
unnecessary work - or would need to cache the mount and know when to
unmount it....

On the other hand, changing the user-visible behaviour of the client
unexpected hanging waiting for a server-side copy completion
notification that it will never get seems like a user-visible change
that would be desirable.

I'm starting to see why this is awkward.

I thought it was possible to mark patches to tell the stable team
exactly what you want.  Greg certainly seems eager to give maintainers as
much control as they ask for - without requiring them to do anything
they don't want to do.  If you have a clear idea of what you want, it
might be good to spell that out and ask how to achieve it.
