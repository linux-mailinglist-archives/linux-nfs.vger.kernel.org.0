I guess Greg would need to comment on the detailed policies
for stable kernels.
One of the goals for sure is to avoid regressions. If that causes
bugs not to be fixable or features not to be available, than that's
a price that might need to be accepted. A regression is just many many
times worse than an unfixed issue, twice so for something that claims
to be stable.

So, if we are relatively sure that no NFSv4.2 server has the
kernel-3.4.6-knfsd Qnap (NFSv4.1) misbehavior, my change that masks the
new features for NFS<v4.2 might be what makes this patch acceptable
for stable. Otherwise, we should either revert it or make it
opt-in. The latter is not really a good idea if we then differ
from the main branch where we might go for an opt-out solution.
So maybe it's opt-out for main branch and for stable with an
additional guard against NFS<v4.2 at least for -stable.

Just my 0.02â‚¬.
