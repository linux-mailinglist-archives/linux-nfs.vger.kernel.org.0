My focus is code signing. I'm expecting individual executables to
be under a few dozen megabytes in size, on average, and to change
infrequently or never (immutable). Configuration files, shell
scripts, and symlinks will be even smaller on average.

Thus I anticipate that the frequency of eviction should be pretty
small, and the client should be able to read the files in their
entirety quickly. Efficiency comes from reading each file as few
times as possible to maintain its Merkle tree. The cost of
measuring the file is amortized well if the file is used
frequently enough to keep its tree in the client's memory.

The inefficient case is a file that is large and used infrequently,
IIUC.

Can you say more about why you believe that?

We have.

There are two ways to pull data via NFS. One is READ, which assumes
an arbitrarily large byte stream and the ability to seek in it. The
byte stream content is read in sections no larger than "rsize"
(typically 1MB or less). The client has various mechanisms to
detect when the file content has changed on the server, and can use
them to cache the file's content aggressively.

The other is attribute data, which is pulled in a single operation and
is therefore limited in size. There is no cache consistency scheme
for this type of data, so clients typically read it every time there
is an application request for it.

- We could define a named attribute that is a secondary byte stream
associated with a filehandle. It can be arbitrarily large and is
read piecemeal via NFS READ.

- We could define a pNFS layout that enables the storage of the tree
to be on some other storage service. It can be arbitrarily large and is
read piecemeal via NFS READ or some other operation (SCSI, NVMe, etc).

- We could define a new fattr4 attribute that stores metadata (that's
what I've been doing in prototype to store IMA metadata). It is read
and written in its entirety in a single operation.

Essentially that's what we're doing: inventing a new IMA metadata
format that stores a Merkle root hash instead of a linear hash.

The current IMA formats take a single parameter: which hash algo
to use. Merkle tree construction requires a larger set of parameters,
which is why we think a new metadata format is necessary.
