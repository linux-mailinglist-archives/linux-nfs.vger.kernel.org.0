You might well be right, and thank you for digging into this!

Here are the current options being considered, including those that
are completely brain-dead:

o	Document current state.  (Must use call_rcu() if module
	destroys slab of RCU-protected objects.)

	Need to review Julia's and Uladzislau's series of patches
	that change call_rcu() of slab objects to kfree_rcu().

o	Make rcu_barrier() wait for kfree_rcu() objects.  (This is
	surprisingly complex and will wait unnecessarily in some cases.
	However, it does preserve current code.)

o	Make a kfree_rcu_barrier() that waits for kfree_rcu() objects.
	(This avoids the unnecessary waits, but adds complexity to
	kfree_rcu().  This is harder than it looks, but could be done,
	for example by maintaining pairs of per-CPU counters and handling
	them in an SRCU-like fashion.  Need some way of communicating the
	index, though.)

	(There might be use cases where both rcu_barrier() and
	kfree_rcu_barrier() would need to be invoked.)

	A simpler way to implement this is to scan all of the in-flight
	objects, and queue each (either separately or in bulk) using
	call_rcu().  This still has problems with kfree_rcu_mightsleep()
	under low-memory conditions, in which case there are a bunch
	of synchronize_rcu() instances waiting.  These instances could
	use SRCU-like per-CPU arrays of counters.  Or just protect the
	calls to synchronize_rcu() and the later frees with an SRCU
	reader, then have the other end call synchronize_srcu().

o	Make the current kmem_cache_destroy() asynchronously wait for
	all memory to be returned, then complete the destruction.
	(This gets rid of a valuable debugging technique because
	in normal use, it is a bug to attempt to destroy a kmem_cache
	that has objects still allocated.)

o	Make a kmem_cache_destroy_rcu() that asynchronously waits for
	all memory to be returned, then completes the destruction.
	(This raises the question of what to is it takes a "long time"
	for the objects to be freed.)

o	Make a kmem_cache_free_barrier() that blocks until all
	objects in the specified kmem_cache have been freed.

o	Make a kmem_cache_destroy_wait() that waits for all memory to
	be returned, then does the destruction.  This is equivalent to:

		kmem_cache_free_barrier(&mycache);
		kmem_cache_destroy(&mycache);

Uladzislau has started discussions on the last few of these:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZmnL4jkhJLIW924W@pc636/

I have also added this information to a Google Document for
easier tracking:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0rcZLvvjVGejT3523W0rDy_sLFu2LWc_NR3fQItZaA/edit?usp=sharing

Other thoughts?

							Thanx, Paul
