What is it about this set that feels so much more hackish to you? Most
of this set is pretty similar to what we had to revert. Is it just the
timekeeper changes? Why do you feel those are a problem?

Certainly we can drop this series altogether if that's the consensus.

The main exportable filesystem that doesn't have a suitable change
counter now is XFS. Fixing it will require an on-disk format change to
accommodate a new version counter that doesn't increment on atime
updates. This is something the XFS folks were specifically looking to
avoid, but maybe that's the simpler option.

There is also bcachefs which I don't think has a change attr yet. They'd
also likely need a on-disk format change, but hopefully that's a easier
thing to do there since it's a brand new filesystem.

There are a smattering of lesser-used local filesystems (f2fs, nilfs2,
etc.) that have no i_version support. Multigrain timestamps would make
it simple to add better change attribute support there, but they can (in
principle) all undergo an on-disk format change too if they decide to
add one.

Then there are filesystems like ntfs that are exportable, but where we
can't extend the on-disk format. Those could probably benefit from
multigrain timestamps, but those are much lower priority. Not many
people sharing their NTFS filesystem via NFS anyway.
