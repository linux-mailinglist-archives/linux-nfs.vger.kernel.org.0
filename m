Got it. That makes sense and could probably be made to work.
Doing that all in XFS won't be simple though. You'll need to reimplement
stuff like file_modified() and file_update_time(). Those get called from
deep within the VFS and from page fault handlers.

FWIW, that's the main reason the multigrain work was so invasive, even
though it was a filesystem-specific feature.
