Yes, there may be a root squash option that prevents synthesis of root
credentials, but that's not necessarily an impediment:

We assume that the attacker does have access to a userspace NFS client
on the authorised client and that they can synthesize calls.
If so, then GETATTR is unprivileged and will happily give up knowledge
of which owner/group combination to synthesize in an OPEN, READ or
WRITE call.
