Just a single VM with 1G RAM.  Only one client so only one session.
The default batch count for shrinkers is 64 and the reported count of
freeable items is normally scaled down a lot until memory gets really
tight.  So if I only have 6 slots that could be freed the shrinker isn't
going to notice.
I set ->batch to 2 and ->seeks to 0 and the shrinker started freeing
things.  This allowed me to see some bugs.

One that I haven't resolved yet is the need to wait to get confirmation
from the client before rejecting requests with larger numbered slots.

Partly because the kmalloc call is under a spinlock, so we cannot wait. 
But that could be changed with a bit of work.

GFP_KERNEL can block indefinitely, and we don't actually need the
allocation to succeed to satisfy the current request, so it seems wrong
to block at all when we don't need to.

I'm hoping that GFP_NOWAIT will succeed often enough that the slot table
will grow when there is demand - maybe not instantly but not too slowly.
If GFP_NOWAIT doesn't succeed, then reclaim will be happening and the
shrinker will probably ask us to return some slots soon - maybe it isn't
worth trying hard to allocate something we will have to return soon.

Uhm...  No.  I added it so that patch which adds slot retirement could do
something useful before the shrinker was added, and when I added the
shrinker I couldn't bring myself to remove it.  Probably I should.


Thanks for your thoughtful review.
