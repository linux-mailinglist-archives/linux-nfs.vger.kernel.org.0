Concurrent access to the database is synchronized using a shared rwlock (on shared memory).
reexpdb_init.lock is used to make sure that creating and initializing the shared memory/lock
happens once.

Ok.

fsidnums is used to store generated and predefined fsid numbers.
It is only used in reexport modes auto-fsidnum and predefined-fsidnum.

subvolumes contains a list of subvolumes which a are likely in use by
a client. Up start all these paths will get touched such that they can
be exported.

SQLite can generate a unique value, but we cannot select the range.
It will give a value between 0 and 2^64.
We need an id between 1 and 2^32.

Yes, that's why we need the shared rwlock.
