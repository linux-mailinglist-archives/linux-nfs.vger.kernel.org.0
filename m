Hello every experts.

If we can see all delegations on hard-mounted nfs client, which are also
on server cl_revoked list, changed from
NFS_DELEGATION_RETURN_IF_CLOSED|NFS_DELEGATION_REVOKED|NFS_DELEGATION_TEST_EXPIRED
to NFS_DELEGATION_RETURN_IF_CLOSED|NFS_DELEGATION_REVOKED, can we give
some hypothesis on this problem ?

By the way, this problem can be cover over by decreasing file count on
server.

Thanks,
zhangjian
