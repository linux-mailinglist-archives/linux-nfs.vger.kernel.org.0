Thanks for taking a look!

I'm not too crazy about the global lock either, but the global fine
grained value ensures that when we have mtime changes that occur across
filesystems that they appear to be in the correct order.

We could (hypothetically) track an offset per superblock or something,
but then you could see out-of-order timestamps in inodes across
different filesystems (even of the same type). I think it'd better not
to do that if we can get away with it.

Does that really do what you expect here? current_time will return a
value that has already been through timestamp_truncate. Regardless, I
don't think this function makes as big a difference as you might think.

current_mgtime is calling ktime_get_real_ts64, which is an existing
interface that does not take the global spinlock and won't advance the
global offset. That call should be quite cheap.

The reason we can use that call here is because current_ctime and
current_mgtime are only called from  inode_needs_update_time, which is
only called to check whether we need to get write access to the
inode.=A0What we do is look at the current clock and see whether the
timestamps would perceivably change if we were to do the update right
then.

If so, we get write access and then call inode_set_ctime_current(). That
will fetch its own timestamps and reevaluate what sort of update to do.
That's the only place that fetches an expensive fine-grained timestamp
that advances the offset.

So, I think this set already is only getting the expensive fine-grained
timestamps as a last resort.

This is probably an indicator that I need to document this code better
though. It may also be a good idea to reorganize
inode_needs_update_time, current_ctime and current_mgtime for better
clarity.

Many thanks for the comments!
