What?  You're imposing a rebase on completely unfinished and untested
code?  Any idea when Neil will post v2?  Or am I supposed to take his
partial first pass and fix it?

Nice rule, except there is merit in tested code landing without it
having to see last minute academic changes.  These aren't dprintk,
these are disruptive changes that aren't fully formed.  If they were
fully formed I wouldn't be resisting them.

Thanks for that.

If Neil completes his work I'll rebase.  But last time I rebased to
his simplification of the localio protocol (to use array and not
lists, nice changes, appreciated but it took serious work on my part
to fold them in): the code immediately BUG_ON()'d in sunrpc trivially.
So please be considerate of my time and the requirement for code to
actually work.

I'm fine with these changes not landing for 6.11 if warranted.  I just
seriously question the arbitrary nature of what constitutes necessary
change to allow inclusion.

Saving an nfs_file to open_context, etc.  All incremental improvement
(that needs time to stick the landing).

Why do you think it appropriate to cause upheaval on code that has
clearly drawn a line in the sand in terms of established fitness?

Eliding allocation of things and micro-optimizing can come later.  But
I guess I'll just have to agree to disagree with this approach.
Really feels like I'll be forced to keep both pieces when it breaks in
the near-term.

By all means layer on new improvements.  But this fear to establish a
baseline out of fear that we _might_ change it: don't even know where
to begin with that.

Maybe Neil will post a fully working v12 rebased on his changes.
