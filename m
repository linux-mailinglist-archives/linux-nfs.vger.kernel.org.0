Through a quick look, there seems to be at least three structs which have
similar values: struct bio_vec & struct skb_frag & struct page_frag.

As your above agrument about using bio_vec, it seems it is ok to use any
one of them as each one of them seems to have almost all the values we
are using?

Personally, my preference over them: 'struct page_frag' > 'struct skb_frag'
> 'struct bio_vec', as the naming of 'struct page_frag' seems to best match
the page_frag API, 'struct skb_frag' is the second preference because we
mostly need to fill skb frag anyway, and 'struct bio_vec' is the last
preference because it just happen to have almost all the values needed.

Is there any specific reason other than the above "almost all the values you
are using are exposed by that structure already " that you prefer bio_vec?

There are three types of API as proposed in this patchset instead of
two types of API:
1. page_frag_alloc_va() returns [va].
2. page_frag_alloc_pg() returns [page, offset].
3. page_frag_alloc() returns [va] & [page, offset].

You seemed to miss that we need a third naming for the type 3 API.
Do you see type 3 API as a valid API? if yes, what naming are you
suggesting for it? if no, why it is not a valid API?

As your above suggestion, I can safely assume *_ve is 'struct bio_vec',
right?

I am really confused here, you just clarified that you wasn't suggesting
changing the bio_vec, and now you are suggesting passing 'va' via the
'struct bio_vec' pointer?  How is it possible with current definition of
'struct bio_vec'?

struct bio_vec {
	struct page	*bv_page;
	unsigned int	bv_len;
	unsigned int	bv_offset;
};

Or am I mising something obvious here?

If most of the page_frag API callers doesn't access 'struct bio_vec'
directly and use something like bvec_iter_* API to do the accessing,
then I am agreed with the above argument.

But right now, most of the page_frag API callers are accessing 'va'
directly to do the memcpy'ing, and accessing 'page & off & len' directly
to do skb frag filling, so I am not really sure what's the point of
indirection using the 'struct bio_vec' here.

And adding 'struct bio_vec' for page_frag and accessing the value of it
directly may be against of the design choice of 'struct bio_vec', as
there seems to be no inline helper defined to access the value of
'struct bio_vec' directly in bvec.h
