Actually they are not in the same fs, upper and lower are coming from 
different fs', so when trying to mount I get the fallback to 
`uuid=null`. A quick hack circumventing this check makes the mount work.

If you think this is the best way to solve this issue (rather than 
following the VFS helper path for instance), please let me know how can 
I safely lift this restriction, like maybe adding a new flag for this?
