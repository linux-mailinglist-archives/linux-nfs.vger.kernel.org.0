Fair enough. I will look for a different solution.

This is my understanding:

1. Open/lock/delegation state in NFSv4 is represented to clients by an
opaque token called a stateid. NFSv4 open, lock, and delegation stateids
each have an open file associated with them.

2. The "unexport" administrative interface on our NFS server does not
revoke that state. It leaves it in place such that when the share is
subsequently re-exported, the NFS client can present those stateids
to the server and it will recognize and accept them. This makes a
simple "re-export with new export options" operation non-disruptive.

3. While the file system is unexported, I believe that those files are
inaccessible from NFS clients: when an NFS client presents a file handle
that resides on an unexported file system, the response is NFS4ERR_STALE
until such a time when that share is re-exported.

4. The result is that if a share is unexported while NFSv4 clients still
have that share mounted, open/lock/delegation state remains in place,
and the underlying files remain open on the NFS server. That prevents
the shared file system from being unmounted (which is sometimes the very
next step after unexport). As long as the NFS client maintains its lease
(perhaps because it has other shares mounted on that server), those
files remain open.

The workaround is that the server administrator has to use NFSD's
"unlock file system" UI first to revoke the state IDs and close the
files. Then the file system can be unmounted cleanly.


Help me understand what you mean by write count? Currently, IIUC, any
outstanding writes are flushed when each of the files that backs a
stateid is closed.
