I like them myself, but much depends on how much violence they do to
the slab subsystem and to debuggability.

One advantage of the blocking behavior is that it pinpoints memory
leaks from that slab.  On the other hand, one can argue that you want
this to block during testing but to be asynchronous in production.
Borrowing someone else's hand, there are probably lots of other arguments
one can make.

Good point!

How about a kmem_cache_destroy_rcu() that marks that specified cache
for destruction, and then a kmem_cache_destroy_barrier() that waits?

I took the liberty of adding your name to the Google document [1] and
adding this section:

	kmem_cache_destroy_rcu/_barrier()

	The idea here is to provide a asynchronous 
	kmem_cache_destroy_rcu() as described above along with a
	kmem_cache_destroy_barrier() that waits for the destruction
	of all prior kmem_cache instances previously passed
	to kmem_cache_destroy_rcu().  Alternatively,  could
	return a cookie that could be passed into a later call to
	kmem_cache_destroy_barrier().  This alternative has the
	advantage of isolating which kmem_cache instance is suffering
	the memory leak.

Please let me know if either liberty is in any way problematic.

The mechanism can always be sabotaged by memory-leak bugs on the part
of the user of the kmem_cache structure in play, right?

OK, but I see your point.  I added this to the existing
"kmem_cache_destroy() Lingers for kfree_rcu()" section:

	One way of preserving this debugging information is to splat if
	all of the slab’s memory has not been freed within a reasonable
	timeframe, perhaps the same 21 seconds that causes an RCU CPU
	stall warning.

Does that capture it?

							Thanx, Paul
