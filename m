I don't think I've seen the PATCH land on the list addressed to nfs-utils
maintainer yet, but I could have missed it.

Otherwise it looks sane to me, but I could be missing some upstream case.

At Red Hat, we use "upstream first" as a leading principle.  If this change
makes sense for upstream, send Adreas' patch along and I am sure Steve D will
consider it or let us know why its not acceptible for upstream.
