Hi nfs-utils developers,

the FOSS server fossies.org - also supporting "nfs-utils" - offers a new 
feature "Source code misspelling reports":

  https://fossies.org/features.html#codespell

Such reports are normally only generated on request, but as Fossies 
administrator I have just created (for testing purposes) an analysis for 
the new "nfs-utils" release 2.4.3:

  https://fossies.org/linux/misc/nfs-utils-2.4.3.tar.bz2/codespell.html

Although after a first review some obviously wrong matches ("false 
positives") are already filtered out (ignored) please inform me if you 
find more of them so that I can force a new improved check if applicable 
(for e.g. maybe some "external" files should be excluded better).

Just for information there are also two supplemental pages

  https://fossies.org/linux/misc/nfs-utils-2.4.3.tar.bz2/codespell_conf.html

showing some used "codespell" configurations and

  https://fossies.org/linux/misc/nfs-utils-2.4.3.tar.bz2/codespell_fps.html

Although only unspectacular errors are found I hope that the report can be 
nevertheless a little bit useful.

If appropriate, additional reports for the current or future development 
versions could be willingly created (but in a special "test" folder that 
isn't integrated in the Fossies standard services and should - at least 
principally - also not be accessible by search engines).

Regards

Jens
