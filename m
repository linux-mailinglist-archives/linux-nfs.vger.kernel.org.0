I have to take some issue here. I still the basic concept is sound. The
original implementation was flawed but I think I have a scheme that
could address the problems with the multigrain series.

That said, everyone seems to be haring off after other solutions. I
don't much care which one we end up with, as long as the problem gets
fixed.

Yeah, I think this scheme is problematic for the reasons Trond pointed
out. I also don't quite see the advantage of this over what Dave Chinner
is proposing (using low-order bits of the ctime nsec field to hold a
change counter).
