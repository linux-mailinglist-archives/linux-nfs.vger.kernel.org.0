Ideas off the top of my head....

It'd be really useful to get a network trace--something like tcpdump -s0
-wtmp.pcap -i<interface>, then reproduce the problem, then look through
it to see if you can find the READDIR or STAT or whatever that results
in the unexpected EIO.  But if takes a while to reproduce, that may be
difficult.

Is there anything in the logs?

It might be worth turning on some more debug logging--see the "rpcdebug"
command.
