Dear friend,

   Good day my dear friend, how are you?  Longest time.  I am happy to
   inform you about my success in getting those inheritance funds
   transfer under the cooperation of a new partner.  Presently I'm in
   INDIA foreign investment projects with my own share of the total sum.
   mean while I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist
   me in transfering those inheritance funds even though it failed us
   some how.  Now contact my secretary in Lome Togo west Africa, her name
   is Rubbecca Johnson at her email address (rubbeccajohnson@gmail.com)
   ask her to send you the total sum of ($ 950,000.00), Nine hundred and
   Fifty thousand United States dollars which I kept for your
   compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in the
   transaction.  I greatly appreciated your efforts at that time.  So feel
   free and contact my secretary Rubbecca Johnson and instruct her where
   to send you the ATM CARD of the total sum ($ 950,000.00).  Please let
   me know immediately when you receive it so that we can share the joy
   after all the suffering at that time.  At this moment I am very busy
   here because of the investment projects that I am having with my new
   partner, finally remember that I had forwarded instructions to my
   secretary on your behalf to receive the ATM CARD, so feel free to get
   in touch with Rubbecca Johnson, she will send the amount to you with
   out any delay.

   Best regards,
   Peter Ben
