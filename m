Yes, I do see alternatives. That's what I've been trying
(unsuccessfully) to describe and get consensus on. I feel like I'm
being ignored and rail-roaded here, because nobody is even
acknowledging that I'm proposing alternatives and keeps insisting
that the only solution is a change of on-disk format.

So, I'll summarise the situation *yet again* in the hope that this
time I won't get people arguing about atime vs i-version and what
constitutes an on-disk format change because that goes nowhere and
does nothing to determine which solution might be acceptible.

The basic situation is this:

If XFS can ignore relatime or lazytime persistent updates for given
situations, then *we don't need to make periodic on-disk updates of
atime*. This makes the whole problem of "persistent atime update bumps
i_version" go away because then we *aren't making persistent atime
updates* except when some other persistent modification that bumps
[cm]time occurs.

But I don't want to do this unconditionally - for systems not
running anything that samples i_version we want relatime/lazytime
to behave as they are supposed to and do periodic persistent updates
as per normal. Principle of least surprise and all that jazz.

So we really need an indication for inodes that we should enable this
mode for the inode. I have asked if we can have per-operation
context flag to trigger this given the needs for io_uring to have
context flags for timestamp updates to be added. 

I have asked if we can have an inode flag set by the VFS or
application code for this. e.g. a flag set by nfsd whenever it accesses a
given inode.

I have asked if this inode flag can just be triggered if we ever see
I_VERSION_QUERIED set or statx is used to retrieve a change cookie,
and whether this is a reliable mechanism for setting such a flag.

I have suggested mechanisms for using masked off bits of timestamps
to encode sub-timestamp granularity change counts and keep them
invisible to userspace and then not using i_version at all for XFS.
This avoids all the problems that the multi-grain timestamp
infrastructure exposed due to variable granularity of user visible
timestamps and ordering across inodes with different granularity.
This is potentially a general solution, too.

So, yeah, there are *lots* of ways we can solve this problem without
needing to change on-disk formats.

-Dave.
