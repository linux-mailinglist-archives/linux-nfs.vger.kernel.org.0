The bz was open by a request of a customer... There is a
lot of info in bzs that are not public... 

Having a one, centralized place to configure NFS
I thought was a good idea...

I'm sure I'm following this analogy with the export...
but being able to set things up from one configuration 
file and command is key. 

nfsconf does an excellent job parsing nfs.conf and I would
like to build on that... 

I understand we have to work well in containers which 
is one of the reason I was trying to come up with a
nfsv4 only nfs-utils... That went over like a lead balloon ;-) 

What I don't understand is why we can't come up with a 
solution that uniquely set a param that is set by 
nfsconf using nfs.conf.
