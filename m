That's kind of what I want to avoid - i want the filesystem to
direct the VFS as to the type of checks and modifications it can
make.

e.g. the timestamp comparisons and actions taken need to be
different for a timestamp-with-integrated-change-counter setup. It
doesn't fold neatly into inode_needs_update_time() - it becomes a
branchy, unreadable mess trying to handle all the different
situations.

Hence the VFS could provide two helpers - one for the existing
timestamp format and one for the new integrated change counter
timestamp. The filesystem can then select the right one to call.

And, further, filesystems that have lazytime enabled should be
checking that early to determine what to do. Lazytime specific
helpers would be useful here.

Certainly. Similar to multi-grain timestamps, I don't see anything
filesystem specific about this mechanism. I think that anyone saying
"it's ok if it's internal to XFS" is still missing the point that
i_version as a VFS construct needs to die.

At most, i_version is only needed for filesystems that don't have
nanosecond timestamp resolution in their on-disk format and so need
some kind of external ctime change counter to provide fine-grained,
sub-timestamp granularity change recording.

Sure. I'm not suggesting that the filesystem duplicate and encode
all these rules itself.

I'm just saying that it seems completely backwards that the VFS
encode all this generic logic to handle all these separate cases in
a single code path and then provides a callout that allows the
filesystem to override it's decisions (e.g. lazytime) and do
something else.

The filesystem already knows exactly what specific subset of checks
and updates need to be done so call ou tinto the filesystem first
and then run the VFS helpers that do exactly what is needed for
relatime, lazytime, using timestamps with integrated change
counters, etc.

Not really, just seems you're thinking about how to code all the
VFS helpers we'd need a bit differently...
