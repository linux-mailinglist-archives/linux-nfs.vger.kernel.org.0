You can reproduce it with client and server both on rc3.

(In more detail: you need a client with 7c1d1dcc24b3, but a server that
doesn't yet have 6ee65a773096 "Revert "nfsd4: a client's own opens
needn't prevent delegation"".

I have a patch that will restore the server's ability to grant
delegations to clients with write opens, but this regression was one of
the problems I ran across in testing....)
