I really like this concept (I think Lennart has talked about support for
this before?).

Fwiw, I would really like if nsfs and pidfs file handles were signed
specifically because they're not supposed to persist across reboot. But
we can't do that in a backward compatbile way because userspace accesses
the file handle directly to get e.g., the inode number out of it.

But for new types of file handles for such pseudo-fses I think this
would be very lovely to have. It would probably mean generating a
per-boot key that is used to sign such file handles.

For nfs I understand that you probably outsource the problem to
userspace how to generate and share the key.

Fyi, it's not so simple. For some filesystems like pidfs and nsfs they
have custom permission checks and are available to unprivileged users.
But they also don't do any path lookup ofc.

Right, otherwise you break a ton of stuff that relies on stable file
handles across reboots.
