Oh maybe because this is the error path and nfs4_opendata is getting cleaned
up in nfs4_open_release()?  The comments in nfs4_open_release are a bit
confusing, but I think for the cases where we need to re-use the opendata we
are doing a kref_get on it.  Maybe we need a kref_get on the opendata for
this case?

.. I suspect we'd have the o_res.fh from nfs4_opendata_get_inode().  Out of
time, will check back in tomorrow.
