That's going to be very inefficient, and difficult to handle the caching,
preferential eviction, and constant tree rebuilding.

IMO, the only model that really makes sense is one where the full tree is stored
persistently.  Have you considered options for how that could be done in NFS?
What NFS protocol modifications (if any) are in scope?

fs-verity is mostly just a way of hashing a file.  Can't IMA just continue to do
its signatures in the same way, and just swap out the traditional full file hash
with the fs-verity file hash (when it's enabled)?

fs-verity does support its own signature mechanism, because people wanted a
simple knob to set that makes the kernel verify and enforce signatures for all
fs-verity files.  But it's not mandatory to use that.
