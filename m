I was trying to keep the conversation off of what
was being set to how it was being set... 

I had no idea the entire "options nfs" API is compromised
when it comes to containers... Not sure why... but I will
believe you... But is the API  compromised in a 
non-container env? Other than the cloud, isn't non-containers
envs the majority of our install based?

I just assumed, since it had a customer case, the bz was 
private... it turns out not to be the case

It seems to me we could use similar documentation when 
setting the id from nfs.conf.

Fair enough... So we know the sysfs/udev is
actually setting the id?

Right... I was just trying to build a mechanism to
set the value, and not worrying (yet) about what the
value is set to... 

So at this point, all of the nfs kernel module parameter
can be set through the sysfs/udev interface? 

If that is the cause... have the variables in 
nfs.conf create sysfs/udev file would work better?
