Channel bindings require mutual TLS authentication between the server
and the client because the idea is that the client can then be trusted
by the server to authenticate the users.

I'm looking for something that only requires the server to authenticate
to the client, and that then allows the applications running RPC calls
to authenticate their users to the server at the per-RPC level. That
requires stronger authentication at the RPC level, but doesn't need the
full-blown RPCSEC_GSS treatment because we already have privacy
guaranteed at the transport level.
