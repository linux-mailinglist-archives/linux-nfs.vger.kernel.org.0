Oh, got it, thanks for the explanation.

Assuming writes are rare, maybe a dumb retry loop would be adequate.
Sounds like that's what we'd need anyway if we were to share the
database between cooperating re-export servers.  (Would we have a
performance problem in that case, if several reexport servers start at
once and all start trying to populate the shared database?  I don't
know.)

Anyway, it's a judgement call, fair enough.  Might be worth a brief
comment, at least.

OK.  Do you think you could look into that, and strip this down to the
one auto-fsidnum case, and then continue the discussion?  I think that'd
clarify things.

As I say, I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to later adding a reexport=
option back in, but for now I'd first like to see if we can find the
simplest patches that will solve the problem in one good-enough way.

OK.
