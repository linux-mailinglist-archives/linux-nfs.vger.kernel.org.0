Greetings My Dear Friend,

Please reply to my private email ambrosecooker389@gmail.com

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious.This letter must
come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that
people meet and become great friends and business partners. Please I
want you to read this letter very carefully and I must apologize for
barging this message into your mail box without any formal
introduction due to the urgency and confidentiality of this business.
I make this contact with you as I believe that you can be of great
assistance to me. My name is Mr.Ambrose Cooker, from Burkina Faso,
West Africa. I work in African Development Bank (ADB) as Telex
manager, please see this as a confidential message and do not reveal
it to another person and let me know whether you can be of assistance
regarding my proposal below because it is top secret.

I am about to retire from active Banking service to start a new life
but I am skeptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger. You
must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially because
we are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years now
that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to launder
money overseas through the help of their Political advisers. Most of
the funds which they transferred out of the shores of Africa were gold
and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the
continent. T heir Political advisers always inflated the amounts
before
transferring to foreign accounts, so I also used the opportunity to
divert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official
trace of how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such
transfers were being closed after transfer. I acted as the Bank
Officer to most of the politicians and when I discovered that they
were using me to succeed in their greedy act; I also cleaned some of
their banking records from the Bank files and no one cared to ask me
because the money was too much for them to control. They laundered
over $5billion Dollars during the process.

Before I send this message to you, I have already diverted
($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow account belonging to no one in the
bank. The bank is anxious now to know who the beneficiary to the funds
because they have made a lot of profits with the funds. It is more
than Eight years now and most of the politicians are no longer using
our bank to transfer funds overseas. The ($10.5million Dollars) has
been laying waste in our bank and I don't want to retire from the bank
without transferring the funds to a foreign account to enable me share
the proceeds with the receiver (a foreigner). The money will be shared
60% for me and 40% for you. There is no one coming to ask you about
the funds because I secured everything. I only want you to assist me
by providing a reliable bank account where the funds can be
transferred.

You are not to face any difficulties or legal implications as I am
going to handle the transfer personally. If you are capable of
receiving the funds, do let me know immediately to enable me give you
a detailed information on what to do. For me, I have not stolen the
money from anyone because the other people that took the whole money
did not face any problems. This is my chance to grab my own life
opportunity but you must keep the details of the funds secret to avoid
any leakages as no one in the bank knows about my plans.Please get
back to me if you are interested and capable to handle this project, I
am looking forward to hear from you immediately for further
information.Please reply to my private email

Thanks with my best regards.
Mr.Ambrose Cooker.
Telex Manager
African Development Bank (ADB)
Burkina Faso.
