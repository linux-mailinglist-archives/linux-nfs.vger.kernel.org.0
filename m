100% reproducible with any kernel from 4.9 to 5.4, stable or backports. 
It may exist in earlier versions, but I do not have a machine with 
anything before 4.9 to test at present.

 From 1-2 make clean && makeÂ  cycles to one afternoon depending on the 
number of machine cores. More cores/threads the faster it does it.

I tried playing with protocol minor versions, caching options, etc - it 
is still reproducible for any nfs4 settings as long as there is client 
side caching of metadata.
