Yes, -- I misunderstood your suggestion to use nfs_writeback_update_inode()
as a way to fill in our cached attributes with values we'd expect from the
result of the copy.

Ok, thanks for the looks at this, you've convinced me that this patch is
unnecessary.  I still need the first one, let me know if you want me to
resend it as a stand-alone fix.
