Twenty years ago running my own mail service sounded like a fun idea.

Nowadays it's just this thing that means that, every now and then, I
have to drop everything and go learn about some random bit of annoying
tech, just so I can get on with my work or talk to my friends.  Then
I'll promptly forget it, until years later it breaks, and I have to go
relearn it all from scratch.

Anyway, googling DKIM....
