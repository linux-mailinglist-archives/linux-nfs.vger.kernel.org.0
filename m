I'll point out that this last posting I did was an RFC. It was invasive
to the timekeeping code, but I don't think that's a hard requirement for
doing this.

I do appreciate the feedback on this version of the series (particularly
from Thomas who gave a great technical reason why this approach was
wrong), but I don't think we necessarily have to give up on the whole
idea because this particular implementation was too costly.

The core idea for fixing the problem with the original series is sane,
IMO. There is nothing wrong with simply making it that when we stamp a
file with a fine-grained timestamp that we consider that a floor for all
later timestamp updates. The only real question is how to keep that
(global) fine-grained floor offset at a low cost. I think that's a
solvable problem.

I also believe that real, measurable fine-grained timestamp differences
are worthwhile for other use cases beyond NFS. Everyone was pointing out
the problems with lagging timestamps vs. make and rsync, but that's a
double-edged sword. With the current always coarse-grained timestamps,
the ordering of files written within the same jiffy can't be determined
since their timestamps will be identical. We could conceivably change
that with this series.

That said, if this has no chance of ever being merged, then I won't
bother working on it further, and we can try to pursue something that is
(maybe) XFS-specific.

Let me know, either way.
