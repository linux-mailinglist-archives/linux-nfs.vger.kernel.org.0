This won't work because you'd need to reconstruct the whole Merkle tree when
reading the first byte from the file.  Check the fs-verity FAQ
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html#faq) where I
explained this in more detail (fourth question).

Well, the xattr would need to contain the same information as
struct fsverity_enable_arg, the argument to FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY.

I thought there was a desire to just use the existing "integrity.ima"
signature format.

Are you looking for integrity-only protection (protection against accidental
modification), or also for authenticity protection (protection against
malicicous modifications)?  For authenticity, you have to verify the file's hash
against something you trust.  A signature is the usual way to do that.
