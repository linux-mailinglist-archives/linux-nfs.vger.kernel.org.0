I was suggesting using bio_vec, not some new structure. The general
idea is that almost all the values you are using are exposed by that
structure already in the case of the page based calls you were adding,
so it makes sense to use what is there rather than reinventing the
wheel.

I have no idea what you are talking about. The issue was you were
splitting things page_frag_alloc_va and page_frag_alloc_pg. Now it
would be page_frag_alloc and page_frag_alloc_bio or maybe
page_frag_fill_bio which would better explain what you are doing with
this function.

I don't want a new structure. I just want you to use the bio_vec for
spots where you are needing to use a page because you are populating a
bio_vec.

I would suggest doing so via the *_vec pointer. The problem as I see
it is that the existing code is exposing too much of the internals and
setting up the possibility for a system to get corrupted really
easily. At least if you are doing this with a bio_vec you can verify
that you have the correct page and offset before you move the offset
up by the length which should have been provided by the API in the
first place and not just guessed at based on what the fragsz was that
you requested.
