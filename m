Could you point me to sqlite documentation that explains why the user
would need to do their own locking?

I assumed sqlite would do any necessary locking for you.  It seems like
a core function for a database.

The fsidnums also contains that same list of paths, right?  So I don't
understand why we need both.

Also, if we're depending on touching all the paths on startup, something
is wrong.

What we want to do is touch the path when we get an upcall for the given
fsid.  That way we don't have to assume, for example, that the system
will never expire mounts that haven't been used recently.

Surely that CHECK constraint doesn't somehow cause sqlite to generate
non-unique primary keys?  At worst I'd think it would cause INSERTs to
fail if the ordinary primary-key-choosing algorithm chooses something
over 2^32.

--b.
