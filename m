Nice, thanks for testing!

Yes, I had the same understanding...

Well, that is obviously not what the Linux client is asking for today, 
but even if it
did, what would it set in the OPEN_WANT flags for O_WRONLY open? it would
set OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WANT_WRITE_DELEG.

I do agree that there is an argument to be made that Linux nfsd should not
hand out any delegation that is not explicitly solicited by the client, 
but I don't see
how this particular delegation against a wronly open is any different 
from any
other type of delegation that Linux nfsd hands out today.
