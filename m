LOL, yes!

>=20

Those particular atime updates are not a problem. If we're updating the
mtime and ctime anyway, then bumping the change attribute is OK.

The problem is that relatime _also_ does an on-disk update once a day
for just an atime update. On XFS, this means that the change attribute
also gets bumped and the clients invalidate their caches all at once.

That doesn't sound like a big problem at first, but what if you're
sharing a multi-gigabyte r/o file between multiple clients? This sort of
thing is fairly common on render-farm workloads, and all of your clients
will end up invalidating their caches once once a day if you're serving
from XFS.

Similar problem here. Once a day, NFS clients will invalidate the cache
on any static content served from XFS.

I don't think that trying to do something "special" for activity that is
initiated by the NFS server solves anything. Bear in mind that NFS
clients care about locally-initiated activity too.

The bottom line is that we don't want to be foisting a cache
invalidation on the clients just because someone read a file, or did
some similar activity like a readdir or readlink. The lazytime/relatime
options may mitigate the problem, but they're not a real solution.

What NFS _really_ wants is a proper change counter that doesn't
increment on read(like) operations. In practice, that comes down to just
not incrementing it on atime updates.

btrfs, ext4 and tmpfs have this (now). xfs does not because its change
attribute is incremented when an atime update is logged, and that is
evidently something that cannot be changed without an on-disk format
change.

Sure. It's new to me though. It's also not yet merged into mainline.

I'd _really_ like to see a proper change counter added before it's
merged, or at least space in the on-disk inode reserved for one until we
can get it plumbed in. That would suck for the current users, I suppose,
but at least that userbase is small now. Once it's merged, there will be
a lot more people using it and it becomes just that much more difficult.

I suppose bcachefs could try to hold out for the multigrain timestamp
work too, but that may not ever make it in.
