Because if the full tree isn't stored, it defeats most of the point of doing a
Merkle tree based hash.  The filesystem would have to read and hash the full
file up-front, which by itself defeats the main benefit.  Then later, reads from
the file can result in having to rebuild large parts of the tree --- unless the
entire tree is kept pinned in memory, which isn't feasible for large files.

If it's possible, a secondary byte stream associated with the file would be a
good option.  The fs-verity implementation in ext4 and f2fs has been criticized
because the Merkle tree is stored past the end of the file rather than in a
separate file stream, which in theory would be a cleaner solution.

Well, you'll need to store the fsverity_descriptor or something equivalent.  Not
because it would be signed directly (it would be hashed first, as per
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html#file-measurement-computation),
but because it's needed to understand the Merkle tree.

Of course, the bytes that are actually signed need to include not just the hash
itself, but also the type of hash algorithm that was used.  Else it's ambiguous
what the signer intended to sign.

Unfortunately, currently EVM appears to sign a raw hash, which means it is
broken, as the hash algorithm is not authenticated.  I.e. if the bytes
e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 are signed,
there's no way to prove that the signer meant to sign a SHA-256 hash, as opposed
to, say, a Streebog hash.  So that will need to be fixed anyway.  While doing
so, you should reserve some fields so that there's also a flag available to
indicate whether the hash is a traditional full file hash or a fs-verity hash.
